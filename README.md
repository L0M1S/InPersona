# 🎭 InPersona: Social Engineering Tools for Impersonation Scenarios

> ⚠️ This project is intended for **educational** and **ethical research** purposes only. Always ensure you have proper authorization before using any tool demonstrated here.

Welcome to **InPersona**, a lightweight toolkit designed to simulate **impersonation-based attacks** used in social engineering. This repository is built around an affordable, easy-to-assemble microcontroller device based on the ATmega32u4 chip, capable of mimicking HID input (e.g., keyboard injection) for penetration testing scenarios.

## ✨ Features

- 🔑 USB-based payload injection using ATmega32u4
- 📂 System and network data collection (non-malicious)
- ⚙️ Easily customizable Arduino sketches
- 🎭 Realistic impersonation scenarios for red team simulation
- 🧰 Modular structure for future extensions (e.g., remote exfiltration, detection evasion)

---

## 🧰 What You’ll Need

- Arduino-compatible board with **ATmega32u4** (e.g., Arduino Micro, Leonardo)
- USB cable
- Arduino IDE ([Download here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software))
- Optional: MicroSD module (for multi-payload support)
